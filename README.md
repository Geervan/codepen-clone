# How to host it on a cloud so that you can share it to your friends and family
1. To host it on a cloud you should have a account in heroku or netlify 
2. I prefer netlify for react apps because it is very simple to host on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
3. Go signup on netlify and after you signup go to sites and come back to your terminal and run ```npm run build``` 
4. After you run the build command open your file explorer and go to your project folder and you will find a build folder.
5.Now drag the build folder and leave it in the area in the netlify's sites section and your project will be deployed to netlify in under 5 secs.
